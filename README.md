# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 (Typescript & Bun)

Hello, this is my attempt at this year's (2023) advent of code challenges. Solutions are written in Typescript and can be run via the Bun JS runtime.

## Running:

Run w/ `bun js`.

Run with sample input:

```bash
  input=sample bun day1/index.ts
```

Otherwise to run with the real input:

```bash
  bun day1/index.ts
```

or

```bash
  input=input bun day1/index.ts
```

## Progress:
